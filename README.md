# portfolio-concept

Disclaimer: This was made for learning purposes and uploaded here so I could see how it looks like on mobile devices. I thought the webpage design was cool and wanted to recreate it. I had, and have no intention of using this for commercial or other monetary purposes. Please contact me, even if you're not the owner of this work, if you find this unacceptable behavior and I'll take it down immediately. Sorry for the trouble and thanks.

This is an imitation/copy of https://danielspatzek.com 's portfolio. I wanted to see if I could recreate it from scratch (haven't dabbled in animations too much atm). Right now the code is really, really sloppy (i.e. media queries take up over half of the CSS code) because I begun with copying how they'd done the positioning and stuff and modified it instead of trying to place out things myself, which in hindsight I should've done in the first place because copying led to a lot of headaches when the web layout broke (and it did, many many times. Their website seems to solve this by "resizing" everytime the window size changes, probably with JS or plugins) and I tried to fix it as best as I could. 

Nonetheless, what I can take from this experience is,

1. Don't try to copy someone's code (especially if they've used plugins!). It will almost certainly break when you try to run it and a lot of it won't make any sense to you. A little surprising was that I got better results when I tried placing out elements myself and writing code for functions such as page transitions.

2. Even if I said the above, I have to say that copying isn't a complete waste of time. You kinda get to think about how and why the programmer wrote the code as it is, and that's kinda interesting. For example, this guy used a lot of absolute positioning which caught me off-guard.

That's all from me, I probably won't touch this any further and if I do decide to work on it again I'll probably salvage what I can (a lot can be reused) and rewrite everything again. From there I would probably add some page transition animation and flesh out the remaining pages. Seriously, as the code is right now, er, it's not a pretty sight.
